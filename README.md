# Quantum computing projects 

1. Quantum Random Number and ASCII Character generator

Using the probabilistic nature of quantum systems, we can create random numbers.

2. The Quantum Teleportation Protocol

I explain the quantum teleportation protocol step by step and represent the initial and final qubits in the Bloch sphere.
